# Delivery Much Star Wars Test

## Description

This is a Vue application which contains a lot of info about my favorite movie series, Star Wars. The app was completely made by me for an job opportunity.

You may notice some extra modules that weren't fully used, but I chose to leave them there in the hope of further expanding this project to a wiki or something like that.
